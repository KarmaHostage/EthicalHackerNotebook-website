#Tools of the Trade

An ethical hacker should not only understand how everything works, he should also know the tools which could automate his assessments.

In this section, we'll elaborate on different toolsets we can use to leverage tasks we often have to perform. Over the years, a lot of different modules, scripts and entire software stacks have been written by companies and communities. They are a proven asset for every developer, security guru and hacker.

We try to put each tool in a suitable category, to make it easier for us to find the best tool for our current task. Some tools will fall under different categories, because they evolved over the years to perform multiple tasks.
